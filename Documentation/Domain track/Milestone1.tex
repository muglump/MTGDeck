	\section*{What does quality mean in terms of mobile development?}
		In terms of mobile development quality is a measure of the functional and aesthetic utility to the consumer.
	\section*{What are the important factors in quality assurance for mobile development?}
		For mobile development there are several key factors that determine if an application is considered of good quality.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Stable and reliable - Mobile applications are generally more difficult to test, as there are frequently more variables then in traditional software development. To ensure that an application is both stable and reliable in additional to traditional testing several other conditions. Conditions such as: no wifi, no cellular data, air-plane mode, device versions, OS versions, screen sizes, etc. Additionally mobile applications must be especially cautious of over-using system resources.
			\item Platform Consistency - For mobile development it is especially important to follow the guidelines of the platform you are developing for. This is important because the platform has a large impact on the UI and the user experience as a whole. When using a certain mobile device the user expects a standard device layout, and navigation controls and venturing outside of that can cause user discomfort.
			\item Loads fast - Form mobile applications fast load times are especially important, as user want rapid results. This means that an application should fully load within at most under 5 seconds or most users will switch to something else.
			\item No Blocking UI - In mobile development UI is undoubtedly the driving force, and what the user is expecting. In more traditional applications a user may wait for several seconds if a program hangs, however in mobile applications any hangs are usually regard a program freezes and results in the program being terminated by the user.
		\end{itemize}
	\section*{What processes are currently used in mobile development to assure quality?}
		From visiting several companies offering mobile application testing to developers there are several key steps that seem universal to mobile application quality assurance.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Functional Testing - Assuring that the application actually does what it was built to do is one of the most key parts of quality assurance for mobile applications. This step generally includes not only ensure the application functions as required but also that it does not consume an inordinate amount of system resources doing it.
			\item Configuration testing - This is an extremely important step in assuring that your mobile application is of good quality. By testing you application in the various operating systems, devices, and other conditions that it will be available on, you ensure that the application will be equally usable for all users.
			\item Usability Testing - Another extremely important step in assuring that you mobile application meets the quality that you desire of it. By including potential user level individuals in your testing process you can identify areas that may be confusing to your potential user base so that they may be corrected. Additionally users may find cases that you never would have tested.
